## Problem statement

Accent Detection: Given an audio clip of a person speaking in English, you are required to
identify the native language of the speaker based on their accent when they are speaking in
English.

## Dataset

You have been given a dataset of audio files of various people - of different native languages -
speaking something. You can use these to train your model. The dataset is organized such that
all audio clips of a speaker of a particular native language are placed within a directory with the
name of the native language of the speaker. For example: All audio clips placed inside the
“afrikaans” directory contain audio clips of people whose native language is afrikaans.

Audio data was taken from Speech Accent Archive <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/speech-accent-archive>

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the basis of:

1) The accuracy scores (weighted F-1 score) of your model
2) Novelty (in any form like model architecture, training methodology or ideation)
3) Clarity of presentation
